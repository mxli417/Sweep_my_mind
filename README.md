# Sweep my mind - Code learning collaboration

This is a repo for (team-) working on a code challenge in C++. 
Main goal is to implement a command-line Mine Sweeper game.

The focus lies on clean code and learning to handle several 
problems in C++ : matrices, random numbers, user-interaction,
and much more.

In the end, this can be extended to also incorporate some 
mine - searching algorithms for finding optimal solutions. 

Currently, the state of the project is in: initialization.
